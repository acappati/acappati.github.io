I am a permanent **Research Scientist** at the [*Commissariat &agrave; l'&eacute;nergie atomique et aux &eacute;nergies alternatives*](https://www.cea.fr) (CEA), Paris-Saclay for the **Direction of Technological Research** (*Direction de la recherche technologique* at the *Laboratoire de vision pour la mod&eacute;lisation e la localisation*, DRT/LIST/DIASI/SIALV/LVML).

I am part of the team of the *Chaire Artificial Intelligence & Complexity*. We study the evolution of **complex systems** both in AI and Physics, in order to understand how to extract and reconstruct a signal and how to increase the performance of current methodologies. We work in the sustainable framework of a **Green AI**, dedicated to streamlining deep learning architectures and to simplify the data treatments.

I got my Ph.D. degree in *Physics and Astrophysics* at the *Università degli Studi di Torino* ([UniTO](https://www.unito.it)) in Italy in December 2020. I dealt with topics on **string theory** and the **interface between geometry and deep learning** techniques.

## My Research

My research interests cover physical and computational problems, the common thread being the relation between mathematics and artificial intelligence, from data acquisition to the analysis. At present, I focus on two principal research areas, related to [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision). The first is the segmentation of hyperspectral images (often issued from spectroscopy techniques, such as [laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser-induced_breakdown_spectroscopy)) using supervised and unsupervised methods to extract relevant information from complex and diverse data. The other is geometric deep learning and [representation learning](https://paperswithcode.com/task/representation-learning) for computer vision: I study the properties of hyperspectral images using [Graph Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network) and geometry. I am also interested in applications of machine and deep learning to the theory of mathematics and physics, such as algebraic geometry and string theory, for their fascinating structures and their ability to provide geometrical insights on the behaviour of neural network architectures.

## My Thesis

I started my graduate studies in [Torino, Italy](https://goo.gl/maps/8AeAw5Wy7EmY2xHr7) in 2017, at the [*Università degli Studi di Torino*](https://www.unito.it), under the advisory of [Prof. Igor Pesando](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=1E277GoAAAAJ).

I focused my research on **string theory and conformal field theory** and applications of **deep learning in algebraic geometry**. Main topics of my work have been the study of conformal twist and spin fields, cosmological singularities and time dependent orbifolds, and AI techniques for Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds.

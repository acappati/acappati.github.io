I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at the [*Commissariat &agrave; l'&eacute;nergie atomique et aux &eacute;nergies alternatives*](https://www.cea.fr) (CEA), Paris-Saclay for the **Direction of Energies** (*Direction des &eacute;nergies* at the *Laboratoire d'analyse nucl&eacute;aire, isotopique et &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire*, DES/ISAS/DPC/SEARS/LANIE) and the **Direction of Technological Research** (*Direction de la recherche technologique* at the *Laboratoire de vision pour la mod&eacute;lisation e la localisation*, DRT/LIST/DIASI/SIALV/LVML).

I got my Ph.D. degree in *Physics and Astrophysics* at the *Università degli Studi di Torino* ([UniTO](https://www.unito.it)) in Italy in December 2020. I dealt with topics on **string theory** and the **interface between geometry and deep learning** techniques.

## My Research

My research is focused on applications of **AI methods** to **physical data**. Specifically, I am trying to extend the use of **unsupervised learning** techniques in order to improve signal recovering, with a behaviour similar to an AI, rather than simply a geometrical transformation on the original data. The approach is part of the framework of [sustainable AI](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-021-00043-6), aimed at reducing the complexity of the data and cutting the impact of large scale development: advanced **dimensionality reduction** techniques can in fact have a great impact on modern applications both in terms of costs and results. For this, the development of new **theoretical frameworks** are necessary: in many cases, the interface between them and the present state-of-the-art is represented by physics and its theoretical tools, developed for different tasks, which can be extended in a larger design.

I am also interested in **validation techniques** for the predictions of **deep learning** models. The key idea is to reduce the *black box*-like complexity of these models, and to provide a way to doublecheck the models during inference. For this, I am working on experimental data using [LIBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser-induced_breakdown_spectroscopy) techniques, which enable the study of the composition of materials using laser interactions.

Finally, I still deal with **deep learning** and AI techniques for **topological data**, namely in the field of string theory and dynamical models. I am interested in the challenges these particular data pose, and how **AI** can represent a means to explore them.

## My Thesis

I started my graduate studies in [Torino, Italy](https://goo.gl/maps/8AeAw5Wy7EmY2xHr7) in 2017, at the [*Università degli Studi di Torino*](https://www.unito.it), under the advisory of [Prof. Igor Pesando](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=1E277GoAAAAJ).

I focused my research on **string theory and conformal field theory** and applications of **deep learning in algebraic geometry**. Main topics of my work have been the study of conformal twist and spin fields, cosmological singularities and time dependent orbifolds, and AI techniques for Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds.

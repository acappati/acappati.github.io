Hello!  My name is Riccardo and I am a <ins>postdoctoral researcher</ins> at the [*Commissariat &agrave; l'&eacute;nergie atomique et aux &eacute;nergies alternatives*](https://www.cea.fr) (CEA), Paris-Saclay. I share my current position between the **Direction of Energies** (*Direction des &eacute;nergies* at the *Laboratoire d'analyse isotopique &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire*, DES/ISAS/DPC/SEARS/LANIE) and the **Direction of Technological Research** (*Direction de la recherche technologique* at the *Laboratoire de vision pour la mod&eacute;lisation e la localisation*, DRT/LIST/DIASI/SIALV/LVML).

I got my Ph.D. degree in *Physics and Astrophysics* at the *Università degli Studi di Torino* ([UniTO](https://www.unito.it)) in Italy in December 2020. My thesis dealt with topics of **string theory** and the <ins>interface between geometry and artificial intelligence</ins>. I am currently still working on such topics, while also focusing on other applications of AI to physical data.

## My Research

My research is focused on <ins>applications of AI</ins> methods to physical data. Specifically, I am trying to extend the use of **unsupervised machine learning** methods (such as [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)) in order to be able to apply such techniques on a wider range of cases, with a behaviour similar to an AI, rather than simply a geometrical transformation on the original data. The approach is part of the framework of [sustainable AI](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-021-00043-6), aimed at <ins>reducing the complexity of the data and cutting the impact of large scale development</ins>: advanced **dimensionality reduction** techniques can in fact have a great impact on modern applications both in terms of costs and results. For this, the development of new **theoretical frameworks** are necessary: in many cases, the interface between them and the present state-of-the-art is <ins>represented by physics</ins>, and its theoretical tools, developed for different tasks, which can be extended in a larger design.

## My Thesis

I started my graduate studies in [Torino, Italy](https://goo.gl/maps/8AeAw5Wy7EmY2xHr7) in 2017, at the [*Università degli Studi di Torino*](https://www.unito.it), under the advisory of [Prof. Igor Pesando](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=1E277GoAAAAJ).

I focused my research on <ins>string theory and conformal field theory</ins> and applications of <ins>deep learning in algebraic geometry</ins>. Main topics of my work have been the study of conformal **twist and spin fields**, **cosmological singularities** and **time dependent orbifolds**, and AI techniques for **Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau** manifolds.

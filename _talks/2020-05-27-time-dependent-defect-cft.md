In this video-poster, presented online due to the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) pandemic, we present a new method to compute amplitudes in the presence of excited spin fields, without resorting to bosonisation. We introduce point-like defects on the open superstring worldsheet, and we show that, though time dependent, the theory is still conformal.

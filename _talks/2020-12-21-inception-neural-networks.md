In this talk, still online due to the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) pandemic, we introduce a new neural network architecture, inspired by Google's Inception network, capable of predicting the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$ with more than $99\%$ of accuracy. The results represent a large improvement on previous attempts at the same task, by increasing the reached accuracy by more than $20\%$.

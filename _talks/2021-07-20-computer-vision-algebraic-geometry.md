We rephrase a central problem in algebraic geometry and theoretical physics as a computer vision task. Leveraging knowledge of the physical data with the introduction of architectures inspired by Googleâ€™s Inception network, we reach almost perfect accuracy on the predictions. We thus prove the versatility of the AI models and their reliability in making accurate physical predictions.

We consider time-dependent orbifolds in String Theory and we show that divergences are not associated with a gravitational backreaction since they appear in the open string sector too. They are related to the non existence of the underlying effective field theory as in several cases fourth and higher order contact terms do not exist. Since contact terms may arise from the exchange of string massive states, we investigate and show that some three points amplitudes with one massive state in the open string sector are divergent on the time-dependent orbifolds. To check that divergences are associated with the existence of a discrete zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the subspace with vanishing volume, we construct the Generalized Null Boost Orbifold where this phenomenon can be turned on and off.

We consider a two-dimensional fermion on the strip in the presence of an arbitrary number of zero-dimensional boundary changing defects. We show that the theory is still conformal with time dependent stress-energy tensor and that the allowed defects can be understood as excited spin fields. Finally we compute correlation functions involving these excited spin fields without using bosonization.
